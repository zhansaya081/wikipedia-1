Cameron is producing the film with Jon Landau, with Josh Friedman originally announced as Cameron's co-writer; it was later announced that Cameron, Friedman, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Shane Salerno took a part in the writing process of all sequels before being attributed separate scripts, making the eventual writing credits unclear.<sup> [8][9][10][11]  </sup> Cast members Sam Worthington, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Saldana">Zoe Saldana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Lang">Stephen Lang</a>, Giovanni Ribisi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_David_Moore">Joel David Moore</a> , Dileep Rao, CCH Pounder, and Matt Gerald are all reprising their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in a different role. <sup>[12] </sup> New cast members include Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell, Michelle Yeoh, Jemaine Clement, Oona Chaplin, Vin Diesel, and CJ Jones. <sup>[13] </sup> 

<br><br>
Cameron, who had stated in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it were successful, announced the first two sequels in 2010 following the widespread success of the first film, with Avatar 2 aiming for a 2014 release.<sup>[14][15][16] </sup> However, the subsequent addition of three more sequels, and the necessity to develop new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, pre-production, and visual effects. The film has been subject to 8 delays to its theatrical release, with the latest occurring on July 23, 2020;<sup> [17] </sup> it is currently planned for a release on December 16, 2022,<sup>[18] </sup> with the following three sequels to be released, respectively, on December 20, 2024, December 18, 2026 and December 22, 2028.[19][20]

Preliminary shooting for the film started in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Beach,_California">Manhattan Beach, California</a>, on August 15, 2017, followed by principal photography simultaneously with Avatar 3 in New Zealand on September 25, 2017; filming concluded in late September 2020, after over three years of shooting. </q>

	Avatar 2 had entered production and started preliminary shooting on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan Beach, California, as the main shooting location. <sup>[105]</sup>

Principal photography started on September 25, 2017, simultaneously with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_3">Avatar 3</a>.<sup>[48][106][107]</sup> As Sigourney Weaver later revealed in November, filming had to be moved around to allow her to film a cameo appearance in the series eight finale of Doc Martin. <sup>[108]</sup>

On November 23, Cameron stated that the crew had been undergoing tests with the cast for the last month to film underwater scenes in performance capture, and that they succeeded in filming the first of those on November 14, featuring six of their seven main child actors, including Trinity Bliss.<sup>[35]</sup> He stated "we're getting really good data, beautiful character motion and great facial performance capture. We've basically cracked the code".<sup>[97][98]</sup> He said that tests would last until January 2018, as "we're still working in our small test tank. We graduate to our big tank in January".[97] It was "a dialogue scene", as according to Cameron, the characters communicate via "a kind of a sign language".<sup>[35]</sup> On April 30, 2018, Kate Winslet had "just a couple days" of shooting left to do.<sup>[109]</sup>

In May 2018, Saldana stated that filming was "kind of only halfway done" and that the crew is "about [to finish] motion capture production on the [second and third] movies, and then after that, they go straight into pre-production for the live-action part that would shoot for six months in New Zealand."<sup>[110] </sup> Saldana finished shooting her scenes on June 8, for both Avatar 2 and its sequel, while Cameron stated around the same time that 130 days of performance capture had been shot.<sup>[37][38]</sup> On November 14, 2018, Cameron announced filming with the principal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture">performance capture</a> cast had been completed.<sup></sup>[50]

Avatar 2 is the first of four planned sequels to Avatar; Avatar 3 started filming simultaneously with Avatar 2 in New Zealand on September 25, 2017. Avatar 2 cast members Worthington, Saldana, Lang, Weaver, Pounder, Curtis, Ribisi, Moore, Rao, Gerald and Chaplin have all been announced for Avatar 3<sup>[138]</sup> Although the last two sequels have been reportedly greenlit, Cameron stated in a November 2017 interview: "Let's face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don't make enough money, there's not going to be a 4 and 5".<sup>[35]</sup> Avatar 3 cast member David Thewlis later confirmed this in February 2018, stating "they're making 2 and 3, they're gonna see if people go and see them, and then they'll make 4 and 5."<sup>[101]</sup> Conversely, Weaver stated in November 2018, after the first two sequels had completed main photography, that she was currently "busy doing Avatar 4 and 5", which several media outlets interpreted as confirmation that the last two sequels had started filming.<sup>[139][140][141]</sup> In January 2019, in face of the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that both Avatar 4 and Avatar 5 are being developed but haven't been officially greenlit.<sup>[142]</sup> According to producer Landau in February 2019, Iger may have been misinterpreted. He said that Avatar 4 and 5 "are not only [greenlit]" but also a third of Avatar 4 has already been filmed.<sup>[143]</sup>
